DAY 5
1. Add Lombok dependency
lombok is for stopping writing getters, setters, constructors manually

I    @Data       // Getter, Setter, ToString, EqualsAndHashCode I
I    @NoArgsConstructor                                         I
I    @AllArgsConstructor                                        I
I    @Builder    // Fluent builder pattern                      I


DTO - Data Transfer Object
There are some data types like passwords, adresses that shouldn't be sent to the frontend.
DTO is for sending only necessary data.


return bookRepository.findAll().stream()
        .map(book -> modelMapper.map(book, BooksDTO.class))
        .collect(Collectors.toList());

Explanation: 
üîç What this line does (in plain English):
It:

Fetches all Book entities from the database.

Converts each Book entity into a BooksDTO using ModelMapper.

Collects the converted DTOs into a List<BooksDTO>.

Returns the result.

DAY 6
Swagger is a set of tools of documenting and testing REST APIs.

üîß What Does Swagger Do?
1. Generates API Documentation Automatically
Once you annotate your controllers, Swagger will:

List all your endpoints

Show request/response examples

Display parameter types

All of this ‚Äî live, interactive, and updated instantly.

2. Provides a UI (Swagger UI)
Swagger creates a browser-based UI at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html:

You can:

View endpoints

Fill request bodies

Execute GET/POST/PUT/DELETE right in the browser

Instantly see the response

This makes Swagger a live testing playground ‚Äî no need to open Postman.
